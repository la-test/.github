## Welcome

Thank you for considering contributing to our project.
Help is always welcomed!


## Communicating effectively

Before you open an issue or pull request, or ask a question in chat, keep these points in mind to help your ideas come across effectively.

**Give context**. Help others get quickly up to speed. If you’re running into an error, explain what you’re trying to do and how to reproduce it. If you’re suggesting a new idea, explain why you think it’d be useful to the project (not just to you!).

**Do your homework beforehand**. It’s OK not to know things, but show that you tried. Before asking for help, be sure to check the project’s README, documentation, issues (open or closed), and search the internet for an answer. People will appreciate it when you demonstrate that you’re trying to learn.

**Keep requests short and direct**. Much like sending an email, every contribution, no matter how simple or helpful, requires someone else’s review. Our project(s) may have more incoming requests than people available to help. Be concise. You will increase the chance that someone will be able to help you.

**Keep all communication public**. Although it’s tempting, don’t reach out to maintainers privately unless you need to share sensitive information (such as a security issue or serious conduct violation). When you keep the conversation public, more people can learn and benefit from your exchange. Discussions can be, in themselves, contributions.

**Respect community decisions**. Your ideas may differ from the community’s priorities or vision. They may offer feedback or decide not to pursue your idea. While you should discuss and look for compromise, maintainers have to live with your decision longer than you will. If you disagree with their direction, you can always work on your own fork or start your own project.

**Above all, keep it classy**. Open source is made up of collaborators from all over the world. Context gets lost across languages, cultures, geographies, and time zones. In addition, written communication makes it harder to convey a tone or mood. Assume good intentions in these conversations. It’s fine to politely push back on an idea, ask for more context, or further clarify your position. Just try to leave the internet a better place than when you found it.


## Opening an issue

You should usually open an issue in the following situations:

- Report an error you can’t solve yourself
- Discuss a high-level topic or idea (for example, community, vision or policies)
- Propose a new feature or other project idea

Tips for communicating on issues:

- If you see an open issue that you want to tackle, comment on the issue to let people know you’re on it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.
- If an issue was opened a while ago, it’s possible that it’s being addressed somewhere else, or has already been resolved, so comment to ask for confirmation before starting work.
- If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own, comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue. Even documenting that outcome is a contribution to the project.


## Opening a pull request

You should usually open a pull request in the following situations:

- Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
- Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you’ve already discussed, in an issue

A pull request doesn’t have to represent finished work. It’s usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just open it as a “draft” or mark as a “WIP” (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.

Here’s how to submit a pull request:

- [**Fork the repository**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. (See more detailed instructions here.)
- [**Create a branch**](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for your edits.
- **Reference any relevant issues** or supporting documentation in your PR (for example, “Closes #37.”)
- **Include screenshots of the before and after** if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
- **Test your changes**! Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.
- **Contribute in the style of the project** to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi-colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.
